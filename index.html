        <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Maudiel Alexander Romero and I am a junior at Rutgers University, 
          where I am pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. Currently, I have an 
          Associates Degree in Computer Science from Bergen Community College (go Bulldogs!). 
          I also have a number of non-academic pursuits and interests that fulfill my passions 
          and social responsibility. For instance, I am the president of the Queer and Christian Club 
          (the QUAC) and also the treasurer for the Out in Tech club (OiTRU). 
          These clubs work in earnest to ensure a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community, and I am 
          very proud to be an integral part of both groups. The main purpose of the OiTRU e-Board is 
          to give computer science and IT students hands-on experience by redesigning websites for local
          businesses. As for career goals, I hope to enter the field of full stack proggramer as a 
          well-rounded developer.

          If you have any questions, please shoot me an email through the icon above.

        <h3>GALLERY</h3>
        <p>Other than playing video games and running, I am very passionate about photography. 
          In particular, I enjoy capturing beautiful landscapes and shots of nature. I hope you 
          enjoy the photos in the gallery, that I have personally captured over the course of 8 years, 
          in the same way that I enjoyed taking them!

        <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
      
        <p>
          
           In my ‘Principles of Information and Data Management’ class, my group and I designed a relational 
           database system to support the operations of an online travel reservation platform. We used HTML for 
           the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity
           between the user interface and database server; under the ‘Projects’ tab, I have provided some 
           detailed examples of my contributions to the team.
           To view the project in full, please click on the Github icon on the top left </p>
